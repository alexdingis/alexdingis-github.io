            <h3>Welcome to the Longitudinal Tract Web Map</h3>
            <p>The Longitudinal Tract Web Map (LTWM) is an interactive web map that lets users explore neighborhood change from 1970 to 2020 by clicking on areas to visualize historical trends and patterns. The LTWM is a full-stack project that I built to simplify neighborhood change analysis by eliminating the need to download and process data, allowing anyone—from researchers to the public—to instantly access, visualize, and interact with historical trends through an intuitive point-and-click interface. The LTWM uses Firebase for data storage and API access, GitHub Pages to host the interactive web interface, Leaflet to deploy the web map, Mapbox vector tiles to visualize neighborhoods across the United States, and High Charts to visualize the trends.</p>
            <p>The Longitudinal Tract Web Map (LTWM) draws on data from the <a href="https://s4.ad.brown.edu/projects/diversity/researcher/bridging.htm" target="_blank">Longitudinal Tract Database</a> (LTDB), developed by Dr. John R. Logan, Dr. Zengwang Xu, and Dr. Brian Stults, which harmonized U.S. Decennial Census data from 1970 to 2020 to consistent 2010 census tract boundaries. The LTWM uses 1970–2000 data from the LTDB and employs IPUMS NHGIS crosswalks to align this data, along with 2010 Census data, to 2020 census tract boundaries, while incorporating 2020 Decennial Census data in its original form.</p>
            <p>This web map helps you answer the question: "<b>How has my neighborhood changed since 1970?</b>"</p>
            <h3>How to Use</h3>
            <p>Select one or more census tracts then click Get Data. The graph below the map will populate with trends about the selected neighborhoods. You can then use the dropdown above the graph to view different trends about the selected neighborhoods.</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>The Longitudinal Tract Web Map (LTWM) is an interactive tool designed to enhance the Longitudinal Tract Database (LTDB). It provides researchers and policymakers with an easy-to-use platform for analyzing neighborhood changes over time.</p>
            <h3>Project Development</h3>
            <p>I began working on this tool one month before the birth of my first child. I had little previous web development experience. I knew I'd need to implement project management, divide the project into chunks, and work on what I could when I could in order to complete this project.</p>
            <h4>Purpose</h4>
            <p>At the start of this project, I defined success as creating a web page with an interactive map. The goal was for users to click on a census tract and instantly see a graph illustrating changes in population and housing characteristics from 1970 to 2020.</p>
            <h4>Project Scoping</h4>
            <p>The first step of this project was to define the project scope and research tools that could help me deploy this web page. There are <i>many</i> tools to build a webpage. Because this is my first webpage, I chose to stick with simple tools such as GitHub pages to host the page, Leaflet to deploy the web map, and Firebase to host my data.</p>
            <h4>Dataset Construction</h4>
            <p>The second step of this project was to compile and organize the LTDB into a dataset that I could host online then query. The LTDB is a census tract (neighborhood) harmonized dataset of decennial census data between 1970 and 2010. The harmonization is important because not only do census tract boundaries change over time, the United States did not have full coverage of census tracts until 2000. Although the LTDB was available in 2010 census tract, I was building this web page in early 2025. I decided to use the <a href="https://www.nhgis.org/geographic-crosswalks" target="_blank">IPUMS-NHGIS Geographic Crosswalks</a> to bring forward the LTDB into 2020 census tracts. There are some risks here such as loss of data accuracy, however, I felt the tradeoff was worth it because I could later link to more recent data and after the 2030 decennial census then be more likely to crosswalk that data to 2020 census tract boundaries so there is a bit of future-proofing./</p>

            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>The inspiration for the Longitudinal Tract Web Map comes from the Neighborhood Change Web Map (NCWM), a project that I managed by a Social Science Analyst at HUD. You can read more about the NCWM <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250131225035/https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr-edge-spotlight-article-061124.html", target = "_blank">here</a>. The purpose of the NCWM was to reimagine the many large, administrative datasets available into a point-and-click tool to generate insights and analysis far faster than the previous methods of compiling and analyzing the data.</p>
            <p>I am the subject matter expert for the HUD-USPS Address Data. Since 2005, HUD has collected snapshots of. These data are <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C9&authuser=1&q=usps+vacancy+data&btnG="target="_blank">widely used in housing vacancy research</a>, however, they're underutilized in other research such as measuring housing supply <i>growth</i>. While many researchers used this data, they had to download and compile the data to generate insights. This was out of reach for many practitioners and other stakeholders who either did not have bandwidth or technical capacity to do so. To overcome this challenge, I envisioned a point-and-click webmap that queries longitudinal administrative data then displays it in a concise way to uncover trends.</p>
